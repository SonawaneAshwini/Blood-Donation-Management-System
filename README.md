## Introduction

Blood donation plays a crucial role in saving lives during emergencies, surgeries, and chronic conditions. However, traditional systems often rely on intermediaries such as hospitals or clinics, introducing delays and additional costs.

The **Blood Donation Management System** addresses these challenges by creating a centralized platform where:
- Donors can manage their availability.
- Patients can request blood directly from donors.
- Communities can actively engage in life-saving efforts.

This system is secure, cost-effective, and user-friendly, built to revolutionize how blood donations are managed.
